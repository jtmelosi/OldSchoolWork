//      Things to do:
// (int) sout's
// add in personalized stats, when doing that, make sure to add in a 'enemy.' for damage return on each battler
// find a way to sort by current hp (flat and percent-wise), or just find highest and lowest one (or maybe first few, depending)
// gamble upgrade (fortune teller maybe), and towns/nodes to upgrade at
// possibly set max battlers
// 
// 
// 
// 
// 
// 


//      Notes:
// group passive could possibly increase their stats (not temp stats) and then reduce if the source died.
// 


//      Ideas to include:
// defense based regen
// on death effects
// stuff according to current hp left (defense, damage on ability, etc)
// on enemy kill effects
// comparison to stats (if health/speed/whatever is lower, then this)
// shield break (multiplied damage vs shields), or shield bypass
// shield regen
// shield vamp
// switch function of ability at layers of current hp
// health/shield/turnProgress/attack/defense percent increase x many times on random stat of whichever ones are chosen
// high current hp function (+90% hp and it'll autocrit that target)
// reduce damage each turn by a % of max/current/missing hp
// % chance on receiving damage to convert it to a heal
// flat damage increase on attacks based on enemy's hp
// increase highest stat
// passive AOE damage each turn (or random targeting)
// Attack a random enemy to heal an ally (or attack a target to heal a random ally)
// blow up all dot damage, or do dot damage based on remaining dot damage
// randomly attack enemies until full hp w/ 100% lifesteal
// turn reset on kill
// sacrifice health to hurt enemy
// modulus of stat changing what an ability does
//

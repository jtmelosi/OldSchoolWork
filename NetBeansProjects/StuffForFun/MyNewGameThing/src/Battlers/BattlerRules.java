/*
 *-If ability descriptions dont say otherwise, abilities are based on a coefficient of power.
 *-You can always look in the character's class to see exactly how abilities are calculated.
 *-This is for which stats are increased by how much from levelup points (additive).
 * (Health:40)(Speed:2)(Power:4)(Defense:2.5)(DefensePen:2)(Mastery:1)
 * (CritDamage:3.5%)(Dodge:2.5%)(Accuracy:2%)(CritRate:1.5%)(DamageReturn:1.5%)
 *  Above are only the base amounts, certain characters may have different amounts
 *-Each point of defense increases your effective health by 1% mathematically.
 *-If the character has nothing is stated to increase from mastery, one or more abilities will increase off mastery by a certain amount.
 *-If killed, a battler's current health will drop to ((-2*maxHealth)+(-2*overkill)).
